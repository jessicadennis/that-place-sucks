# That Place Sucks

A React learning project with an AWS Amplify backend, using GraphQL endpoints for CRUD operations. Powered by Amplify, Vite, React, and Bootstrap. And other libraries here and there. **Very much still under development!**

The purpose is to keep track of restaurants that I've been to, how I rate them on a scale of 1 – 10, and any notes about the experience.

Coming soon: tracking and rating individual dishes.

## Build

Well, you kinda can't, unless you're me, or you set up identical Amplify infrastructure, or I give you my API key (which I am not going to do). If you *are* me, well that's weird, but in that case, you already know what to do: install and configure the Amplify CLI and `npm install`.

## Run

If you are not me, and thus running locally is not an option, get in touch and I'll tell you where to see the current deployed application, hosted by AWS. I'll need to register you in Cognito. My current AWS bill for this project is less than 25¢ a month, and I'd like to keep in on the order of that. Otherwise, if you are, oddly enough, me, run `npm run dev` to launch the dev server.
